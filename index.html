		Ambuluwawa Tower is located in the suburbs of Gampola Town in Sri Lanka. There has been an increased popularity in recent times especially due to the breathtaking views you can experience when you climb to the top of the Ambuluwawa Tower. It is also known for its narrow spiral staircase which some visitors find challenging to climb. It is one of the coolest places to visit in Sri Lanka if you are up for the challenge. 
		The 48 meters tall, cone-shaped tower houses the Stupa (Pagoda) of the Buddhist Temple. As you climb up, it has several viewing platforms for you to enjoy the stunning views. The staircase gets narrower as you go up. The spiral staircase will be a challenging one to climb if you are not comfortable with heights.
